# Galaxy on Fire native remake

An independent Godot engine for **Galaxy on Fire 1, iPhone edition**. Supply your
own compatible IPA; the engine imports its ships, environments, artwork, music,
text, missions and catalogues locally. No original game content is included.

## Screenshots

Captured in the remake using locally imported game assets.

## Version 1.0

Play the thirteen-mission linear campaign, then explore freely. **Skip campaign ·
Explore** enters exploration directly without completion rewards. Trade, outfit
ships, accept contracts or play Survival with a separate score archive.

**Swarm** is a remake-authored arcade mode. It opens on a handful of fighters and
grows into a crowd that closes from every side, with surges after the fifth
minute. You start with a shield and a slow standing repair, and the swarm hits
softer early and harder as the run goes on. Every kill fills the level bar under
your hull and shield readouts, and each level lets you pick one of three upgrade
cards: mount a new weapon, refit it further up its line, add a muzzle or muzzle
velocity, extend its range, upgrade your shield, repair hull on every kill, or
transfer to a different hull. Declining a card repairs a quarter of your hull
instead, so healing is a choice you make rather than a pickup you chase. Every
weapon, shield and hull is the one from your game file, unchanged; the
population, pacing, damage scaling and cards are new to this remake. Reaching a
rank on the Survival score ladder unlocks the next hull to fly.

The remake adds keyboard/mouse and controller controls, variable throttle, time
acceleration, persistent checkpoints and a compact desktop interface with scalable
text. Touch controls are available on mobile and can be switched in Options.
Original icons, portraits and interface artwork come from your game file.
Map travel uses a short departure/arrival fade.

This is an independently designed reimplementation, not emulation or a line-by-line
port. Original program code is never executed or cached. Exact legacy animation,
AI choreography and driver quirks are not claimed to be identical.

## Install and play

- **Windows x86-64:** extract the package and run `gof1.exe`.
- **Linux x86-64:** extract and run `gof1.x86_64` (allow execution if your file
  manager removed its executable permission).
- **Linux ARM64:** extract and run `gof1.arm64` the same way. This build is for
  64-bit ARM machines such as a Raspberry Pi 5 or an ARM laptop, and needs a
  working desktop OpenGL or Vulkan driver.
- **macOS Apple silicon / Intel:** extract the universal `.app` package. It is
  unsigned and not notarized; macOS may require approval in Privacy & Security.
- **Android ARM64 / x86-64:** install the signed APK, then choose your IPA using
  the system file picker. Android 7 or newer is required.
- **Web:** open [galaxian.wwworm.com](https://galaxian.wwworm.com/) and choose your
  IPA. Import runs entirely inside your browser; the archive is not uploaded. Keep
  the tab open during import.

Select **Choose game IPA…**, wait for import to finish, then start or load a pilot.
Native desktop builds also accept dragging an IPA onto the window. No converter,
Python, Java, Node.js or iPhone runtime is needed by players. First import can take
several minutes, especially on mobile or in a browser. Cancel stops at an import
checkpoint and preserves previously installed content and saves.

### Compatible game files

The validated archive identifies itself as iPhone **1.1.5**. Acceptance is based on
resource structure and supported data layout, not a fixed filename or checksum.
The current reader needs an unencrypted ARM32 application with its content symbols;
unsupported variants report an error. Other editions have not been validated.
J2ME JARs are not accepted. Keep your IPA so you can recreate the local cache.

### Browser requirements

On iPhone, open the HTTPS site in Safari and choose **Share → Add to Home Screen**.
Launch its home-screen icon for full-screen play. Keep **Aspect ratio: Auto** to
fill the available screen.

Use a browser supporting WebGL 2, WebAssembly threads and persistent site storage.
Browser saves and imported content belong to that browser profile and site origin;
clearing site data removes them, and private browsing may not preserve them.
Mobile browsers can use touch controls, but physical mobile-browser performance
has not been verified. Native desktop builds are preferable on low-memory devices.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard / mouse | Controller |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Steer | Mouse or arrow keys | Right stick |
| Strafe | A / D | Left stick |
| Throttle | W / S | D-pad up / down |
| Fire | Left click or Space | RT or A |
| Next primary weapon | Q | X |
| Missiles | F | LT |
| Boost | Shift | Left stick click |
| Autopilot to objective / station | R | LB |
| Time acceleration | T | RB |
| Dock near the station hull | E | Y |
| Chase / first-person camera | C | — |
| Release / capture mouse | Tab | — |
| Dismiss radio | Enter / tap the panel | — |
| Pause | Escape | Start |
| Action freeze | P or Pause menu | Pause menu |
| Save / fullscreen | F5 / F11 | — |

Time acceleration runs repeated simulation steps: up to 2× manually and 16× on
autopilot. Hostiles, damage or approaching a destination return it to 1×. Focus
loss and active-controller disconnect pause the game.

Options includes sensitivity, inversion, aim assistance, touch controls, linked
primary firing and separate music/effects volume. Select **Options → Language**
to cycle through the languages included in your IPA; your choice is saved.
Remake-specific settings and help currently use English. Inversion reverses pitch
on the Y axis for mouse, controller and touch. Arrow keys keep their direction.
The previous remake flight controls are the default. Enable **Options → Controls →
Original flight controls** for reconstructed iPhone-style ship agility, inertia and
banking. This mode uses imported steering declarations, with adapted mouse input
and smoothed bank animation; exact iOS handling is still under validation.

Under **Options → Display → Flight display**, disable **Show flight text overlays**
to hide the added objective, speed/autopilot readout and notifications. Disable
**Show extra flight buttons** to hide the throttle and navigation controls while keeping
the original touch controls. Mission dialogue and required confirmations remain
visible. **Show touch controls** controls all flight action buttons.

On touchscreens, steer with the joystick; it keeps following your finger across
the screen once grabbed. Touch nearby in the lower-left area to place the pad
under your thumb for that gesture; releasing returns it to its usual position.
Drag the remaining open view to look around; release to return the camera forward. The right-edge throttle keeps its setting
after release, and Boost triggers a temporary burst. Navigation sits above the
stick; Speedup appears beside it during safe autopilot, and Dock appears near an
eligible station. In joystick mode, touch steering, throttle, Boost and firing cancel autopilot
and return simulation speed to 1×.
Hold **Fire** to shoot, or **double-tap Fire** to enable autofire. **AUTO** appears
on the fire button while enabled; tap Fire once to stop. Pausing clears autofire.

With touch controls enabled, **Pause → Adjust controls** places them by hand. Drag
any control to move it, tap one to select it, then use **Smaller** and **Bigger** to
resize it. The stick, throttle, action buttons and navigation buttons can all be
moved and resized. **Reset this** restores one control and **Reset all** the whole
original composition; **Done** keeps the arrangement and **Cancel** discards it.
Placements are stored per player and follow the original layout on a new screen.
Touch instructions appear first under **Options → Controls → Help** when touch
controls are enabled. Android Back pauses/resumes flight or returns from a menu.
On supported phones, **Options → Controls → Steering settings → Motion steering** enables calibrated
tilt steering, with sensitivity and a **Center motion controls** action. Hold your
phone comfortably before enabling or centering it. Browsers may ask for sensor
permission. Motion steering hides and disables the joystick. Autopilot stays
engaged while you move the phone; tap Navigation again to resume manual steering.
Throttle, Boost and firing return time to normal while keeping autopilot engaged
in this mode. Arrival stops and mission control still apply.
This is a remake feature; physical-device tuning is still unverified.
Full key remapping is not implemented.

**Action freeze** pauses the scene for screenshots. Drag to orbit, right-drag to pan
and scroll to zoom; on touchscreens, use two fingers to pan and zoom. **Hide UI**
removes the controls; H or a double-tap restores them. Resume returns to the same
flight state and camera. Controller sticks move the camera and triggers zoom.

Under **Options → Display**, toggle **Fullscreen** or choose an **Aspect ratio**.
**Auto** fills your browser or resizable window; fixed ratios preserve the picture
with borders where needed. F11 also toggles fullscreen. If your browser releases
the mouse, click the flight view to capture it again. **Frame rate limit** caps
rendering at 30, 60, 90, 120, 144 or 240 frames per second; **Auto** follows the
refresh rate of the screen the window is on, and **Unlimited** leaves only
vertical sync. Flight renders smoothly at any of these: the simulation keeps its
fixed step and the picture is blended between steps.

## Saves and updates

Each IPA has a separate content identity, cache and saves. Campaign, exploration
Survival and Swarm use separate slots. Checkpoint writes preserve a `.bak` recovery copy;
failed writes are reported without replacing the last valid save. Previous preview
pilots remain compatible. Old imported caches may require choosing the IPA again;
1.0.18 reads weapon and radio sound selections from the archive, so a cache from
an earlier version asks for the IPA once. Saves are kept.

**Load / recover** in Pause, or **Load** after defeat, lets you choose the latest
autosave, the mission/flight start, or the last station. Earlier checkpoints restore
the entire pilot state and discard subsequent progress. They are preserved when
in-flight autosaves update. Older saves without these snapshots offer an explicit
station recovery: repair the ship and reset the unfinished mission while keeping
the saved inventory and credits, without completion rewards.

**Game files → Transfer saves** exports campaign, exploration and Survival saves
together in a `.gofsave` file. Import the same IPA on the destination device, then
import that save file. The import lists the slots it will replace and preserves a
backup of existing saves. Game assets are not included in the transfer.

Native desktop data lives in the Godot user-data directory named `gof1-remake`
(`~/.local/share/gof1-remake/` on Linux). Android uses private application storage;
uninstalling the app removes that storage. The first release uses a release signing
key, so old debug-signed development APKs cannot be updated in place.

The imported cache contains original resources and normalized data. It is private
player content and must not be included when sharing engine source or builds.

Original content and trademarks belong to their rights holders. This is not an
official Fishlabs release, and the engine license grants no rights to game assets.
File formats and behavior were investigated using supplied games; this is not a
clean-room claim.
